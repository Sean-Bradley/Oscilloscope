## X Y Oscilloscope

https://sean-bradley.github.io/Oscilloscope/

Accepts live input from 'microphone' or 'stereo mix' sources.

You will need to allow your browser to access your microphone when alerted.

Left Input channel affects X and right input channel affects Y.

Playing sine wave in left channel and cosine wave in right channel draws a circle.

Written to work Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge Browser.

On windows, right click speaker icon in task bar, and click 'Recording Devices'

Choose 'Stereo Mix' as default device and make sure it's level is set to 100.

If 'Stereo Mix' option is not visible, right click in devices area and tick 'Show Disabled Devices' and 'Show Disconnected Devices'

If 'Stereo Mix' is still not visible, you may need to update the RealTek High Definition Audio drivers from the RealTek website.

If all settings are correct then playing synth music from your desktop will produce patterns in the display.
